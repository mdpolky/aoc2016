# aoc2016

A set of Clojure namespaces that are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016)
problems.

This code is not indented to illustrate any more than what it can look like to solve some problems in a REPL.
They are quite literally a record of my stream of consciousness.

## Usage

Just load each namespace into a REPL and play.
